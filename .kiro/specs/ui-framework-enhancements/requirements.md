# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses missing core UI framework components in the Godin framework that are essential for building complete applications. Currently, the framework lacks dialog systems, bottom sheets, navigation management, theming support, and responsive design capabilities. This feature will implement Flutter-like UI components including showDialog, showBottomSheet, navigation system, theme management, and MediaQuery functionality to provide a complete UI development experience.

## Requirements

3. WHEN showDialog is called with barrierDismissible false THEN clicking outside the dialog SHALL NOT close it
4. WHEN a dialog has action buttons THEN button callbacks SHALL execute Go functions on the server
5. WHEN dialog actions complete THEN the dialog SHALL close automatically if specified
6. WHEN multiple dialogs are shown THEN they SHALL stack properly with correct z-index
7. WHEN showDialog returns a Future THEN it SHALL resolve with the dialog result when closed
8. WHEN dialog content changes THEN the dialog SHALL update without closing
9. WHEN dialog is dismissed THEN any cleanup callbacks SHALL be executed
10. WHEN dialog is shown THEN keyboard focus SHALL be trapped within the dialog

5. WHEN bottom sheet has scrollable content THEN scrolling SHALL work properly within the sheet
6. WHEN bottom sheet is dismissed THEN it SHALL slide down with animation
7. WHEN bottom sheet callbacks are provided THEN they SHALL execute Go functions on the server
8. WHEN bottom sheet content changes THEN it SHALL update without dismissing
9. WHEN multiple bottom sheets are requested THEN only one SHALL be shown at a time
10. WHEN bottom sheet is shown THEN appropriate accessibility attributes SHALL be set

### Requirement 3

2. WHEN Navigator.pop is called THEN the current page SHALL be removed and previous page shown
3. WHEN Navigator.pushReplacement is called THEN current page SHALL be replaced with new page
4. WHEN Navigator.pushAndRemoveUntil is called THEN navigation stack SHALL be cleared to specified point
5. WHEN Navigator.popUntil is called THEN pages SHALL be popped until condition is met
6. WHEN navigation occurs THEN page transitions SHALL be animated smoothly
7. WHEN navigation state changes THEN browser URL SHALL update appropriately
8. WHEN browser back button is pressed THEN Navigator.pop SHALL be triggered
9. WHEN navigation callbacks are provided THEN they SHALL execute Go functions on the server
10. WHEN navigation occurs THEN page lifecycle callbacks SHALL be called appropriately
11. WHEN named routes are used THEN navigation SHALL work with route names
12. WHEN route parameters are passed THEN they SHALL be available in the destination page
13. WHEN navigation guards are set THEN they SHALL prevent navigation when conditions aren't met
14. WHEN deep linking is used THEN the app SHALL navigate to the correct page with parameters

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive theme management, so that I can create consistent styling and support light/dark themes throughout my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new App THEN I SHALL be able to inject theme configuration during app initialization
2. WHEN App is created with theme THEN the theme SHALL be available globally throughout the application
3. WHEN Theme.of(context) is called THEN it SHALL return the current theme data
4. WHEN ThemeData is defined THEN it SHALL contain color scheme, typography, and component themes
5. WHEN theme changes THEN all widgets SHALL update to use new theme values
6. WHEN dark theme is enabled THEN appropriate dark colors SHALL be used throughout the app
7. WHEN light theme is enabled THEN appropriate light colors SHALL be used throughout the app
8. WHEN custom theme colors are defined THEN they SHALL be available via Theme.of(context)
9. WHEN theme extensions are added THEN custom theme data SHALL be accessible
10. WHEN system theme changes THEN app theme SHALL update automatically if configured
11. WHEN theme animations are enabled THEN theme transitions SHALL be smooth
12. WHEN theme is applied THEN CSS custom properties SHALL be generated for consistent styling
13. WHEN component-specific themes are defined THEN they SHALL override default theme values
14. WHEN theme inheritance is used THEN child widgets SHALL inherit parent theme values

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want MediaQuery functionality, so that I can create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and device capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MediaQuery.of(context) is called THEN it SHALL return current screen dimensions and device info
2. WHEN screen size changes THEN MediaQuery data SHALL update automatically
3. WHEN device orientation changes THEN MediaQuery SHALL reflect the new orientation
4. WHEN device pixel ratio changes THEN MediaQuery SHALL provide updated pixel density info
5. WHEN accessibility settings change THEN MediaQuery SHALL reflect text scale and other a11y settings
6. WHEN platform capabilities change THEN MediaQuery SHALL provide updated platform info
7. WHEN responsive breakpoints are defined THEN they SHALL be available through MediaQuery
8. WHEN MediaQuery data changes THEN dependent widgets SHALL rebuild automatically
9. WHEN viewport insets change THEN MediaQuery SHALL provide updated safe area information
10. WHEN device theme preference changes THEN MediaQuery SHALL reflect the system theme preference

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Scaffold enhancements with proper app bar, drawer, and bottom navigation integration, so that I can build complete app layouts easily.
