# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical gaps in the Godin framework's interactive widget system. Currently, button clicks with OnPressed callbacks don't execute the Go functions, TextEditingController is missing for form inputs, and state management integration needs improvement. This feature will implement a complete Flutter-like interactive widget system that executes Go functions on the backend and properly manages state.

47. WHEN any interactive widget callback execution completes THEN the UI SHALL update automatically to reflect any state changes

### Requirement 2
